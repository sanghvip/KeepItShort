# KeepItShort
KeepItShort is focused on summarizing the input text leveraging the emerging the frontend Technology(React.js) and NLP skills using Python. The text summarisation script is programmed with basic algorithms and techniques like term frequency, tokenizing sentences and scoring sentences.
